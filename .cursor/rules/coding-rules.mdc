Beati Cafe Frontend Coding Rules (Next.js + TailwindCSS)

Separation of Concerns & Mock Data

Always abstract logic, data, and UI.

Never place mock data directly inside a .tsx component file.

Keep mock data in a dedicated data/ file and import it where needed.

Example:

app/home/data/products.ts
app/home/data/team.ts

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each component, function, or module should handle one responsibility only.

Avoid bloated .tsx files by splitting large components into smaller, reusable pieces.

Example:

app/home/components/
├── Hero.tsx
├── ProductCard.tsx
└── CTAButton.tsx

Folder & File Structure

Organize app/ folders by page or feature.

Follow kebab-case for folder and file names.

Example for a home page:

app/home/
├── components/ # Reusable UI components
│ ├── hero.tsx
│ ├── product-card.tsx
│ └── cta-button.tsx
├── data/ # Mock/static data
│ └── products.ts
├── hooks/ # Custom hooks
│ └── useFeaturedProducts.ts
├── page.tsx # Main home page component
└── layout.tsx # Optional page layout

Naming Conventions

Files / Folders: kebab-case (product-card.tsx)

Variables: camelCase (productList, isLoading)

Functions / Components: PascalCase (SubmitForm, ProductCard)

Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (MAX_PRODUCTS)

Types / Interfaces: PascalCase (Product, UserProfile)

Hooks: camelCase starting with use (useFetchProducts)

UI & Styling

Use TailwindCSS for all styling.

Prefer shadcn/ui components for buttons, cards, forms, and layout elements.

Maintain a clean, modern, and cozy aesthetic: warm colors, smooth shadows, rounded corners.

Keep responsive design in mind (desktop + mobile).

Type Safety

Use TypeScript for all props, state, and mock data.

Define interfaces and types in dedicated files if needed.

Avoid any unless strictly necessary.

Reusability & Modularity

Components, hooks, and utilities should be reusable across pages.

Avoid duplication by extracting common UI elements or logic.
